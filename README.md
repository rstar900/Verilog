# Verilog
Contains some Verilog code written or tested by me.

</br> The folders for Nandland Go board projects contain: </br>
1. Constraint files (Pin naming for the board)
2. Project files (Lattice iCEcube2 project)
3. Source files (the Verilog code)
4. Programmer config (Setting for Lttice Diamond Programmer. Might need to change the Port depending on PC)
